**Overview**

An M/M/1 queuing model was developed to analyze utilization rates, mean wait times, and average queue lengths for the City of Garland's fire and medical first responder system. The conclusions drawn from this anlaysis helped influence and support decisions by senior leadership in the Garland Fire Department.

**Features**

Data munging and aggregation across multiple time formates, utilization of the "queueing" package in R, and analysis of statistical distributions (exponential) are critical to the outcome of this project. 

**Impact**

The project help support decisions made for establishing boundary conditions and equipment placement for district 4 in the City of Garland, by comparing inter-arrival times, transit times, and utilization rates to the Portland Fire and Rescue Service Delivery System Study conducted in 2006. For example, the service times for Station 4 along with the utilization rates (<45%) never exceed the critical threshold established by the study.
