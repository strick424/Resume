**Overview**

An M/M/1 queuing model was developed to analyze utilization rates, mean wait times, and average queue lengths for the City of Garland's fire and medical first responder system. The conclusions drawn from this anlaysis helped influence and support decisions by senior leadership in the Garland Fire Department.

**Features**

Data munging and aggregation across multiple time formats, utilization of the "queueing" package in R, and analysis of statistical distributions (exponential) were critical to the outcome of this project and were used extensively during analysis.  

**Impact**

The project helped support decisions made for establishing boundary conditions and equipment placement for district 4 in the City of Garland by comparing inter-arrival times, transit times, and utilization rates to a Portland Fire and Rescue Service Delivery System Study conducted in 2006. For example, the service times for Station 4 along with the utilization rates (<45%) never exceed the critical threshold established by the study. The report provided valuable feedback to Fire Chief and was used to influence future work in the department for analyzing other districts in the city.
