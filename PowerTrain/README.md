**Overview**

Competency to objective mapping and ranking using NLP: implementation of text mining procedures to conduct similarity comparison and exact term matching.

**Features**

Utilizing the data provided, a sorted list of mapped course objectives relating to individual competencies is achieved. The use of various text analysis methods (jaccard distance and cosine similarity) to find the closest set of objectives to each competency is used. In addition, the algorithm utilizes the given search terms provided by the client to senure the objectives are matched to each compentency correctly. The output of the project is a CSV file containing the objectives matched to each compentency along with the rank, compentency number, course and objective number, and similarity score. 

**Example**

*Competency*: Understand different types of contracts.

*Competency Search Terms*: contract type, types of contracts, fixed price, fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, labor-hour

*Objectives Matched*: 
1. Differentiate between different types of contracts. 
2. Explain different contracting methods and contract types.
3. Identify the types of contracts, price structures, and incentives used to manage risk and motivate contractor performance.
4. Given a scenario, recommend the appropriate contract type and price structure to incentivize the contractor to meet program objectives.
