**Overview**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) seminar showcasing NLP techniques to analyze text. Use of sentiment analysis, n-gram network analysis, and machine learning to predict categorized data.

**Features** 

Using R, we create an n-gram network overlayed with sentiment scores (positive, neutral, and negative) to identify key responses in the survey. The network enables us to better understand the frequency and sentiment of specific bigrams in the survey. We use similarity comparison (cosine similarity) to group comments and find trends among the responses (unsupervised learning). We are able to identify 11 common themes throughout the survey - highlighting actionable concerns brought forth from the participants. Finally, we use machine learning to train a model on the 11 common themes, and predict categories for responses not yet identified. 

**Impact**

The results of this survey played a critical role in the planning of furture iterations of USNA summer training. Specifically, more exposure to specific platform such as physical fitness, aviation, and peer leadership were reevaluated in the subsequent years 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the results were presented to the USNA Data Science seminar where multiple organization began requesting help for analyzing their own surveys - spawning a new era of text mining at USNA.
