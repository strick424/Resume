Being able to talk to all the enlisted war fighting instructors at TBS was an awesome experience and gave me a better understanding of how the Fleet at large operated.,Don't prioritize liberty. This gave many people the wrong focus and a huge amount of complaining came from people wanting liberty rather than wanting to train. ,I have always wanted to be a Marine and Leatherneck cemented that desire by showing me the awesome opportunities that I could have. ,Fighting boredom and cynicism. Nothing was overtly difficult but often times you were waiting for word to be passed which would take forever and you were unable to do anything until word was received. ,"The FEX's were supposed to be culminating events but lacked the full intensity. There were no night ops and that was because there was a focus on getting people out to liberty. Liberty was not a focus of Leatherneck and should not be on the schedule or influence decisions. Additionally the rucks were extremely easy. The pace was not difficult and the load was light. On our first ruck we were in full kit (flak kevlar and rifles) but as soon as unprepared people who either didn't hydrate or eat correctly began to fall out the ruck was made easier by shedding flak and kevlar. """,We would be challenged both mentally and physically.  Yes but I felt as though the staff would lay off at certain times rather than push people to their breaking points. ,More aviation stuff one day is not enough when nearly 100 mids will be Marine pilots
Negative (constructive) feedback on leadership weaknesses and presentation of 5 paragraph order. ,Put the Meet&Greet in a bigger room. The bar lounge was very crowded for the event.,Leatherneck was the bestrun most worth while training I have ever done and it ultimately showed me that the Marine Corps is great but just not for me.,Maintaining high energy/staying awake. ,I think the intensity was reasonably distributed. ,I knew I was supposed to take it seriously. had an open mind I did not expect anything one way or another.  Yes – it showed the good and bad in the Marine Corps the staff did not try to sell it by hiding some of the less enjoyable aspects. ,Leatherneck would be even better if we had more motivational talks.
CAPT Brown gave me great advice about what it would be like to have a family as a Marine officer. Another important idea I learned is to have a bias for action in combat. That's one of the things the staff stressed the most.,More MOS representation throughout SPC's. Planning of events to allow for effective use of time.,I was finally able to learn aspects of my job that I'll be doing in just a couple years or less. I was finally exposed to concepts such as land nav squad tactics tactical combat etc. that I've been waiting years for.,ECourse,The ruck could have been more intense.,I expected it to be tough and for it to be an evaluation of my potential as a Marine officer Yes it was tough in certain aspects. There were plenty of moments which worked on our patience. Most of the SPC's seemed really good at their jobs as supervisors and evaluators,Leatherneck was honestly my favorite summer training here at USNA.
Doing squad attacks and learning what I have and lack from a leadership perspective.,Spend more than one day in aviation exposure (Pax River).,My desire to be a Marine increased due to the physical and social aspects of the Marine Corps. The enlisted also played a huge role in this increase (GYSGT Merriman).,Squad Attacks,Rifle cleaning was very common and seemed a bit tedious at times,Difficult fun series of tests Yes because I had an enjoyable experience but was also challenged in ways I have never been before.,I think Leatherneck is an extremely valuable training. I do not think it was a waste of time and the experience I got at Leatherneck helped me make a decision about my career. 
Leading my peers and seeing how I felt and acted as their leader. Also receiving feedback on said leadership ,Minimize standing around time. It is hard because there are so many midshipmen but minimizing waiting time is always something to improve. Also when one or two midshipmen   at a basic task don’t punish everyone for it (i.e. mandatory meals 1 hour before reporting time that take away from sleeping time). ,The interactions with the officers made the training beneficial to deciding to choose USMC ground/air number 1 and 2. ,Putting myself out there and not being afraid to interact with and lead others ,I would have liked the combative training to be longer and allow people to practice more. ,To be treated like an adult and get exposed to the USMC. For the most part no. We were micromanaged (rightfully so) and the MOS mixer was our only exposure to the rest of the Marine Corps outside of TBS. ,My service selection decision has become much more difficult as a direct result of Leatherneck.
Being a part of a small unit where you spent almost all of your time with and had to work through problems with them. You were not able to choose your platoon so you had to quickly adapt and work through challenges with people you likely have never met before.,Keep allowing beers in the fridge. It was honestly the best part of Leatherneck was being able to have a drink after being hot and tired all day. It also demonstrated a lot of trust from the staff that the midshipmen definitely noticed and appreciated.,It exposed me to what being a Marine Officer is like. Seeing my SPC and watching him interact with us like he would with his own marines showed me that I value the same things he (and a lot of other Marine Officers) value. ,Really long days with very little downtime,I believe the FEX's should have been more intense. More patrols with the always present possibility of being attacked all night security in Patrol Bases where attacks are possible. Have Marine TADs come and act as OpFor or have platoons rotate for OpFor attacks.,Semper Fi Society motivators treating us like 18yearold PFC’s some weapons demonstrations physical evolutions and leadership lectures. I also expected the rough and suckitup mentality the marine corps is typically associated with.  Yes and no. There was not a large population of “motivators” there and most people were personable which is a great thing. We were also treated more like adults than I have ever been treated in the last three years. I was surprised at how many accommodations were made for us when the marine corps is known for its suckitup culture. ,It was a great experience that I am glad to have done and have learned much about my leadership abilities and myself as a person. 
It's always important to be a good team player and helping each other out is good. However in a competitive evaluated course sometimes you shouldn't hurt yourself by trying to help everyone.,Include more various MOS's and include more enlisted mentorship.,I have always wanted to go Marine Corps and Leatherneck confirmed my desire.,Trying to stay engaged and focused after a long day in the field. It was easier to get grumpy and lazy.,I think that the training events at Leatherneck had an appropriate level of intensity although it did vary across platoons according to SPC/ASPCs.,I expected Leatherneck to very physically and mentally exhausting and give us good insight into the Marine Corps. Leatherneck was physically and mentally demanding but I believe a regular regiment of PT would have been helpful. Also I felt that Leatherneck gave us insight about TBS but lacked other aspects of a typical day in the Marine Corps that one would experience on a MAGTF Cruise. ,It would be beneficial to have more representation from the logistics communities and lesser popular MOS's since not all Marines will end up becoming infantry or in a direct combat role. Also a senior enlisted panel with several SNCO's could be beneficial to better understanding the roles of SNCO's and what they believe about leadership.
New relationships with classmates whom I had never interacted with before.,"I thought Leatherneck was balanced well and the logistical side of things was awesome. I know many people complained about ""hurry up and wait"" but I understand that moving 500+ students in new ways isn't the easiest task to accomplish.",I feel like I performed well at Leatherneck and that showed me that not only is USMC what I want to do it's also what I'd be best at.,Creating orders for the fex and being able to carry them out,I think we should have done three rucks or also ruck back from one of the events we rucked to. ,I thought it was going to be challenging but fun. Yes there were definitely times where I was challenged and I never stopped having fun.,I think if Leatherneck stays the way it is it should be explained that it is going to be what TBS is like before hand.  
The FEX's had great training value. ,If logistically possible I would recommend splitting Leatherneck into more defined periods of evaluationa portion where Mids are evaluated by the USMC and a portion where Mids are evaluating the USMC. For example a fourweek rotation one of which takes place at TBS and evaluates the Midshipmen while the other three are a rotation between a GCE ACE and LCE.,"I have found it difficult to separate my feelings about the Marine Corps from my feelings about Leatherneck because I do not feel as though Leatherneck was at all representative of what a career in the Marine Corps might truly look like. I met some phenomenal Marines but I also had a sizable amount of encounters with Marines (many officers) who struck me as not great people. I learned a great deal at Leatherneck but (as mentioned earlier) it felt much more like ""mini TBS"" than exposure to the USMC and everything it has to offer.",Learning that when I'm in a leadership position among my peers I need to take charge even when I'm not totally confident because none of us were completely confident during LNK we were all learning.  The balance between being a leader and being peers with your platoon mates.  The Ecourse was definitely harder than I anticipated as well.,Solo land nav instead of as a group ,"Exposure to the Marine Corps and a wide variety of Marines; physically and mentally challenging training. Leatherneck was a mixed bag for me. I learned a lot and met a lot of Marines but did not feel as though I was exposed to the Marine Corps and a wide variety of MOSs as much as I felt like I was attending ""mini TBS."" It was a worthwhile training but not what I was expecting.",Because briefing it as a challenging screening event is inaccurate.  Because if it isn't supposed to be like TBS and it is supposed to be a recruiting or a screening tool I think it is currently suffering an identity crisis and needs major changes.
